Project Title:- Github - Sprint 0
Getting Started:- in this reop, several commands were used to help inialise a repository in git, and then adding 3 files to the staging area. Some commands were used to delete one of the files from the repository but was then restored again. Commits show the progress, from creating to deleting to restoring and pushing it to the origin. Basics of git are found in this reop.
